def gini_score(groups, classes):

    Inputs: 
    groups: 2 lists of examples. Each example is a list, where the last element is the label.
    classes: a list of different class labels (it's simply [0.0, 1.0] in this problem)
    Outputs:
    gini: gini score, a real number

def create_split(index, threshold, datalist):
    '''
    Inputs:
    index: The index of the feature used to split data. It starts from 0.
    threshold: The threshold for the given feature based on which to split the data.
        If an example's feature value is < threshold, then it goes to the left group.
        Otherwise (>= threshold), it goes to the right group.
    datalist: A list of samples.

    left: List of samples

def get_best_split(datalist):
    '''
    Inputs:
    datalist: A list of samples. Each sample is a list, the last element is the label.
    Outputs:
    node: A dictionary contains 3 key value pairs, such as: node = {'index': integer, 'value': float, 'groups': a tuple contains two lists of examples}
    Pseudo-code:
    for index in range(#feature): # index is the feature index
    for example in datalist:
        use create_split with (index, example[index]) to divide datalist into two groups
        compute the Gini index for this division
    construct a node with the (index, example[index], groups) that corresponds to the lowest Gini index
