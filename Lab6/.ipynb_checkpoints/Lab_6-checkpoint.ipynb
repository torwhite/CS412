    "Decision trees are among the most powerful Machine Learning tools available today and are used in a wide variety of real-world applications. They are intuitive and easy to interpret. The final decision tree can explain exactly why a specific prediction was made, making it very attractive for operational use. In this section, we will explore how to implement a decision tree from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use for this problem is the `Banknote` dataset. The task is to predict whether a banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph. It is a binary classification problem. The dataset is stored in `data_banknote_authentication.csv` file, which contains 1372 samples(rows), 5 features (column 1-5) for each sample, and the last column (column 6) is the corresponding label.\n",

    "1. no child, i.e., being a terminal node,\n",
    "2. two children that are both terminal nodes;\n",
    "3. one child being a terminal node and the other being an internal node (i.e., has its own children);\n",
    "4. two children which are both internal nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is possible to allow three or more children, but for simplicity, this lab only considers two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node represents a single input feature (attribute) and a split value on that feature, assuming the feature is numeric. The leaf nodes (we will call them as terminal nodes) contain an output class (0 or 1) which is used to make a prediction.\n",
    "Once created, a tree can be navigated for a new example by following the branching criteria in each internal node, until reaching a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a binary decision tree is actually a process of dividing up the input space. A greedy approach is recursive binary splitting, where all the features and different split thresholds are tried using a cost function.\n",
    "The split with the best cost (lowest cost because we minimize cost) is selected. **All input features and all possible split thresholds are evaluated, and the combination of (feature, threshold) that minimizes the cost is chosen.** Then the dataset is divided into two subsets, and the same selection procedure is used in each of the two subsets, hence called **greedy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note we say \"threshold\" because all the features in the `banknote` dataset are numeric (i.e., continuously valued). When a feature is discrete, splitting can be done based on dividing all possible values into two categories, e.g.,\n",
    "{apple, orange} for the left, and {banana, kiwi, peach} for the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, the **Gini cost function** is used which indicates how *pure* a node is.  A node's purity refers to the diversity of labels among all the training examples belonging to the node.\n",

    "The construction of a decision tree consists of three major components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recursive splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Termination condition of recursion: when to stop splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Building a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: termination function (8 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will start with the termination condition, and then move on to the recursion.  Two hyperparamters are important here:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Maximum Tree Depth**. This is the maximum number of predecessors (parent, grandparent, etc) that each node (terminal or internal/non-terminal) can have.  Once the maximum depth of the tree is met, we must stop splitting a node. Deeper trees are more complex and are more likely to overfit the training data.  Note we call the root node to have depth 1 (not 0), its child nodes with depth 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Minimum Node Size**. This is the minimum number of training examples that a node can contain. If a node is split into two groups and one of them falls below this minimum size, then we should stop splitting that group further, i.e., we should make that group a terminal node.  Nodes that account for too few training examples are expected to be too specific and are likely to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two parameters will be specified by the user as input arguments of our tree building procedure.\n",
    "There is one more situation. It is possible that a split is chosen where all examples belong to one group, while the other group is empty. In this case, we will be unable to continue the splitting and should stop.\n",
    "Overall, there are 3 different **stopping conditions** which are clearly illustrated by the following pseudo-code (see the detailed explanations below).  \n",

The best split has already been found for N using `get_best_split`, and the fields `index`, `value`, and `groups` have already been computed for N (but not yet for `left` and `right`). Note that upon the completion of running the pseudo-code, the fields `left` and `right` of N will have been populated, which correspond to the left and right child nodes, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we check \"if either left_g or right_g is empty\" before checking the max depth, because if either the left or the right group is empty, then N will become a terminal node returning its majority class, hence must satisfy the depth check. However, since we are already \"inside\" of N, we cannot change it into a terminal node per se; turning N into a terminal node can only be accomplished by N's own parent node (see the recursion in Step 2 below). As a result, we introduced a trick of adding a left child and a right child for N, both being a terminal node returning the majority class of N.  Strictly speaking, it is possible that the depth of N is already `max_depth`, which makes the left and right child nodes exceeding `max_depth`.  However, since this is just a workaround to represent that N is a terminal node, it does not make any difference in learning and prediction.\n",

    "Building a decision tree involves calling the above functions `get_best_split` and `to_terminal` over and over again on the groups created for each node.\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, all you need to do is to implement the pseudo-code in \"Step 1: termination function\".\n",
    "Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   The two groups of data carried by the given `node` are extracted as left and right data lists for use. Then delete the `groups` field in `node` to save space because it will not be needed any more. This deletion is not reflected in the pseudo-code, and you need to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   Next, we check if either the left group (`left_g`) or the right group (`right_g`) is empty.  If so, create a terminal node for both left and right groups by applying `to_terminal` on the non-empty group.  Yes, even for the empty group, we also adopt the result of `to_terminal` on the (other) non-empty group.  Think why.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   We then check the depth. If `max_depth` is reached by the child node (i.e., the depth of `node` itself has reached `max_depth`-1), then  create terminal nodes for both the left and the right groups using `to_terminal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.   Then we process the left child.  If the left group's size is below `min_size`, then create a terminal node for it using `to_terminal`. Otherwise, create a split for the left group by `get_best_split`, and assign the resulting node to the `left` field of `node`. Then pass `node[left]` to the `recursive_split` function with 1 + the depth of `node`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.   The right child is then processed in the same manner."
