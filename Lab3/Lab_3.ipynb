    "\n",
    "Cross validation is a technique in which we train our model using a subset of the available dataset and then evaluate using the complementary subset of the data. In this assignment, we use the $n$-fold cross validation method to perform cross validation. In $n$-fold cross validation, we evenly partition the dataset into $n$ mutually disjoint subsets (a.k.a. _folds_). We train an ML model on all but one subset (i.e., train on the union of $n-1$ folds), and then evaluate the model on the subset that was left out.  The former is called _training subset_, while the latter is called _validation subset_. This process is repeated $n$ times, with a different subset reserved for evaluation (and excluded from training) each time. If the size of the dataset is not exactly divisible by $n$, the remainder can be arbitrarily distributed into the folds.\n",
