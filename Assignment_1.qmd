1. For the following distribution, is A ⊥ B (i.e., A and B are independent)? (33 points)

|a |b |P(A=a,B=b)|
|--|--|---|
|0 |0 |0.5|
|0 |1 |0.0|
|1 |0| 0.0|
|1 |1 |0.5|


If $A$ & $B$ are independent then, 

$$
P(A|B) = P(A) \equiv P(B|A) = P(B) \equiv P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)
$$

$$
P(A) = P(A=1, B=0) + P(A=1, B=1)
     = 0.0 + 0.5
     = 0.5
$$

$$
P(B) = P(A=0, B=1)+ P(A=1, B=1)
     = 0.0 + 0.5 
     = 0.5
$$

So, to test independence we can take 

$$
P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)
   0.5 = 0.5 * 0.5 
   0.5 \neq .25
$$

So $A$ & $B$ are **not** independent.

2. For the following distribution, is A ⊥ B|C (i.e., A and B are conditionally independent given C)? (33
points)

|a |b |c |P(A=a,B=b,C=c)|
|--|--|--|--------------|
|0 |0 |0 |0.056|
|0 |0 |1 |0.120|
|0 |1 |0 |0.224|
|0 |1 |1 |0.120|
|1 |0 |0 |0.024|
|1 |0 |1 |0.180|
|1 |1 |0 |0.180|
|1 |1 |1 |0.096|

3. Consider two binary random variables A and B. If A ⊥ B (i.e., A and B are independent), and
P(A = 0, B = 0) = 0.18 and P(A = 1, B = 0) = 0.28, what is the probability of P(A = 0, B = 1)?
(34 points)

|a |b |P(A=a,B=b)|
|--|--|----------|
|0 |0 |0.18|
|0 |1 |n.a.|
|1 |0 |0.28|
|1 |1 |n.a.
