    "### Recap of the Naive Bayes Algorithm  {-}\n",
    "Naive Bayes classification is a fast and simple classification method. Its efficiency stems from some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the conditional independence of features. Suppose for any class $Y$, we have a probability distribution over all possible combinations of values for a feature vector $X$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The main idea of Bayesian classification is to reverse the direction of dependence --- we want to predict the label based on the features:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y|X).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is made possible by the Bayes theorem:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(Y|X) = \\frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)}. \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more concrete, let us consider the SMS message classification problem. Ignoring punctuations, each SMS message contains an ordered sequence of $T$ words (case-insensitive) $X = \\{X_1, ...,X_T\\}$. That is, $X$ corresponds to an SMS message, and $X_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th word in it. For each message from the training set, there is a corresponding label $Y\\in\\{spam, ham\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model specification and key assumption.** The conditional distribution can be written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Since this conditional probability is intractable, we simplify it in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assume** that all features $X_i$ are independent, conditional on the category $Y$. This leads to a naive Bayes model which writes formally as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y) = \\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y). \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assume** that $P(X_i | Y) = P(X_j|Y)$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "In other words, given the label $Y$, the value of the $7$-th word has the same distribution as the value of the $10$-th word. Note this is not assumed by default in naive Bayes, and we make this additional assumption to significantly simplify our model.\n",
    "It is often referred to as \"tying\" the probability $P(X_i|Y)$ over $i$.\n",
    "As a result, the order of words no longer matters for $P(X|Y)$,\n",
    "i.e., \n",
    "$$P(X=\\text{'cat is cute'}|Y) \\ \\ = \\ \\ P(X=\\text{'cute cat is'}|Y) \\quad \\text{for all } Y.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Plugging Eq (2) into the Bayes theorem in Eq (1), we arrive at\n",
    "$$\n",

    "**Making predictions.**\n",
    "Naturally, given an SMS message $X$, we can first compute $P(Y|X)$ for all possible categories $Y$ (in this example, only two categories), and then make predictions by outputting the $Y$ that maximizes the probability. This can be expressed mathmatically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\arg\\max_Y P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y) = \\arg\\max_Y \\left\\{\\log P(Y) + \\sum_{i=1}^T \\log P(X_i|Y) \\right\\}. \\tag{3}\n",

    "If there is a tie, we just break it arbitrarily.\n",
    "Here the logarithm uses natural basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning the model.**\n",
    "To apply the prediction rule in Eq (3), we need to first figure out (formally termed \"estimate\") the value of $P(Y)$ and $P(X_i|Y)$ by using the training data. Recall that since we tie the conditional probabilities $P(X_i|Y)$ across all $i$,\n",
    "the subscript $i$ can be dropped.\n",
    "However, we still carry it just for clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, $P(Y=y)$ can be estimated by computing the frequency of category $y$ in the whole training set ($y$ can be either \"$spam$\" or \"$ham$\"). Here, in order to avoid confusion, we have used the convention that capital letters denote random variables, and lowercase letters denote their possible instantiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, $P(X_i = w |Y=y)$ for a word $w$ (e.g., \"cat\") can be estimated by counting the frequency that it appears in the training message set for a given category $y$ (derivation not required in the course):\n",

    "*Remark 1:* If $w$ appears in a single message for 3 times, then it contributes to $Count(w, y)$ by 3, not 1. Similarly, $Count(y)$ indeed equals the total length of all messages in category $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* Obviously, the right-hand side of Eq (4) does not depend on $i$. This is consistent with our previous note that we carry the subscript $i$ in $P(X_i|Y)$ only for clarity, while in fact different $i$ share the same $P(X_i|Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are four messages \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{{'cat is cute', ham}, {'dog rocks', spam}, {'whatever is is right', ham}, {'hello', spam}.}\n",

    "\n",
    "Quiz (no need to submit): compute $P(X_i = w | \\text{ham})$, for $w = $ 'cat', 'is', 'cute', 'whatever', and 'right'. Check if their sum is 1. Now appreciate why in Remark 1, a word appearing for mulitple times in a single message should be counted multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that any word $w$ with $Count(w,y)=0$ leads to $P(X_i = w|Y=y) = 0$.\n",
    "As a result, by Eq (2), any message $x$ has conditional probably $P(X = x |Y=y) = 0$ if $w$ appears in $x$.\n",
    "Such a \"veto\" is not favorable, and can create significant problems when a word in the test data has never appeared in the training data (think why?).\n",

In Lab 3, we have implemented the `split_nfold()` method from scratch for data partition. In this Lab, we will learn to use the `scikit` library. `scikit` is a powerfull tool for machine learning and data mining, providing plenty of well-designed methods for data analysis. We'll use its `train_test_split()` method to create training and testing sets. In this experiment, we use 80% data for training and the remaining 20% data for testing. To ensure your results are replicable, you need to set the `random_state` argument of `train_test_split()` to **1**.\n",

It is natual to ask how to carry the quantity Count(y) in Equation 5 through the variables that are passed through the functions.  To address this issue, we can create a 'dummy' entry in cond_prob (the variable returned by the function conditional_prob), and set its value to $\\hat{P}(X_i = dummy | Y = y) = \\alpha / (Count(y) + N \\alpha)$.  Then all the words that appear in test data but not in training data can directly use that entry.  Please do not use other key names than 'dummy', because the auto-grader follows this protocal."

    "\n",
    "Once we have the two models $P(Y)$ and $P(X_i|Y)$ from *training*, we can use them to predict the label for a given test message. To this end, we need to compute the probability of all possible labels, and then predict the one with maximum probability value:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid numerical underflow with log-trick.**\n",
    "As shown in the above equation, the calculation involves multiplying many probabilities together. Since probabilities lie in $(0,1]$, multiplying many of them together can lead to numerical underflow (i.e., a floating point number close to 0 gets rounded down to 0 by a computer), especially when $T$ is large, i.e., the test message is long.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this problem, it is common to change the calculation from the product of probabilities to the sum of log probabilities. \n",
    "That is, take the natual logarithm of the right-hand side of Eq (6) as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g_Y(X) = \\log P(Y) + \\sum_{i=1}^T \\log P(X_i|Y). \\tag{7}\n",

    "It is much more numerically stable to compute $g_Y(X)$ and to take $\\arg\\max_Y g_Y(X)$ to find the most likely class label (as the output prediction). \n",

    "With $g_Y(X)$, we can easily compute the posterior probability by\n",

    "m = \\max_y g_y(X).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In our message classification problem, the summation in the denominator is just over `positive` and `negative`.\n",
    "Note we subtract by $m$, which does not change the result because the numerator and denominator cancel.\n",
    "However it is numerically useful because sometimes all $g_Y(X)$ are overly small and can cause numerical underflow inside exponentiation.\n",
    "By subtracting $m$, $g_Y(X) - m$ will be 0 (properly scaled) for at least one value of $Y$, and be negative for the other.  And even if another $y$ still suffers underflow in exponentiating $g_y(X)-m$, the posterior probabilities will still be correct.\n",

    "You may have noticed that the classes are heavily imbalanced. There are only 747 `spam` messages, compared with 4827 `ham` messages. If a classifier simply predicts all messages as `ham`, it will get around 86% accuracy (pretty high). Therefore, accuracy is not a good metric in this case for evaluating the performance of the classifier. As we did before, we can use F-score metrics. But this time we will not implement it from the scratch. Instead, we will learn how to use the builtin methods from `scikit`. [Here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics) is a summary of well-implemented and commonly used metrics for evaluating the quality of a model's predictions. \n",
