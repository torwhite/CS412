    "### Recap of the Naive Bayes Algorithm  {-}\n",
    "Naive Bayes classification is a fast and simple classification method. Its efficiency stems from some simplifications we make about the underlying probability distributions, namely, the assumption about the conditional independence of features. Suppose for any class $Y$, we have a probability distribution over all possible combinations of values for a feature vector $X$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The main idea of Bayesian classification is to reverse the direction of dependence --- we want to predict the label based on the features:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Y|X).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is made possible by the Bayes theorem:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(Y|X) = \\frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)}. \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more concrete, let us consider the SMS message classification problem. Ignoring punctuations, each SMS message contains an ordered sequence of $T$ words (case-insensitive) $X = \\{X_1, ...,X_T\\}$. That is, $X$ corresponds to an SMS message, and $X_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th word in it. For each message from the training set, there is a corresponding label $Y\\in\\{spam, ham\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model specification and key assumption.** The conditional distribution can be written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Since this conditional probability is intractable, we simplify it in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assume** that all features $X_i$ are independent, conditional on the category $Y$. This leads to a naive Bayes model which writes formally as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(X|Y) = P(X_1, ..., X_T|Y) = \\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y). \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assume** that $P(X_i | Y) = P(X_j|Y)$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "In other words, given the label $Y$, the value of the $7$-th word has the same distribution as the value of the $10$-th word. Note this is not assumed by default in naive Bayes, and we make this additional assumption to significantly simplify our model.\n",
    "It is often referred to as \"tying\" the probability $P(X_i|Y)$ over $i$.\n",
    "As a result, the order of words no longer matters for $P(X|Y)$,\n",
    "i.e., \n",
    "$$P(X=\\text{'cat is cute'}|Y) \\ \\ = \\ \\ P(X=\\text{'cute cat is'}|Y) \\quad \\text{for all } Y.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "**Making predictions.**\n",
    "Naturally, given an SMS message $X$, we can first compute $P(Y|X)$ for all possible categories $Y$ (in this example, only two categories), and then make predictions by outputting the $Y$ that maximizes the probability. This can be expressed mathmatically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\arg\\max_Y P(Y)\\prod_{i=1}^T P(X_i|Y) = \\arg\\max_Y \\left\\{\\log P(Y) + \\sum_{i=1}^T \\log P(X_i|Y) \\right\\}. \\tag{3}\n",

    "If there is a tie, we just break it arbitrarily.\n",
    "Here the logarithm uses natural basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning the model.**\n",
    "To apply the prediction rule in Eq (3), we need to first figure out (formally termed \"estimate\") the value of $P(Y)$ and $P(X_i|Y)$ by using the training data. Recall that since we tie the conditional probabilities $P(X_i|Y)$ across all $i$,\n",
    "the subscript $i$ can be dropped.\n",
    "However, we still carry it just for clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, $P(Y=y)$ can be estimated by computing the frequency of category $y$ in the whole training set ($y$ can be either \"$spam$\" or \"$ham$\"). Here, in order to avoid confusion, we have used the convention that capital letters denote random variables, and lowercase letters denote their possible instantiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, $P(X_i = w |Y=y)$ for a word $w$ (e.g., \"cat\") can be estimated by counting the frequency that it appears in the training message set for a given category $y$ (derivation not required in the course):\n",

    "*Remark 1:* If $w$ appears in a single message for 3 times, then it contributes to $Count(w, y)$ by 3, not 1. Similarly, $Count(y)$ indeed equals the total length of all messages in category $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* Obviously, the right-hand side of Eq (4) does not depend on $i$. This is consistent with our previous note that we carry the subscript $i$ in $P(X_i|Y)$ only for clarity, while in fact different $i$ share the same $P(X_i|Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are four messages \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{{'cat is cute', ham}, {'dog rocks', spam}, {'whatever is is right', ham}, {'hello', spam}.}\n",

    "\n",
    "Quiz (no need to submit): compute $P(X_i = w | \\text{ham})$, for $w = $ 'cat', 'is', 'cute', 'whatever', and 'right'. Check if their sum is 1. Now appreciate why in Remark 1, a word appearing for mulitple times in a single message should be counted multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that any word $w$ with $Count(w,y)=0$ leads to $P(X_i = w|Y=y) = 0$.\n",
    "As a result, by Eq (2), any message $x$ has conditional probably $P(X = x |Y=y) = 0$ if $w$ appears in $x$.\n",
    "Such a \"veto\" is not favorable, and can create significant problems when a word in the test data has never appeared in the training data (think why?).\n",

    "#### Step 4: Plot ROC curve and print other results **(16 points)** {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve is one of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms, especially when the classes are imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC is a probability curve for different classes. ROC tells us how good the model is for distinguishing the given classes, in term of the **predicted probability** (not the final hard label in pos/neg). A typical ROC curve has False Positive Rate (FPR) on the $x$-axis and True Positive Rate (TPR) on the $y$-axis. To obtain the FPR and TPR, you can use the `roc_curve` method from `scikit`. This `roc_curve` function takes two arguments: 1) the ground truth labels of the test examples, and 2) the predicted probability that each example is positive. It returns the FPR and TPR which can be used for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even compute the area under the curve (AUC) by calling `roc_auc_score` which takes the same arguments as `roc_curve` required.\n",
    "\n",

    "* If you are working on your own computer, we recommend using the browser (not jupyter) for saving the PDF. For Chrome on a Mac, this is under *File->Print...->Open PDF in Preview*. When the PDF opens in Preview, you can use *Save...* to save it.\n",

For all functions in `Lab_5.py`, copy the corresponding code snippets you have written into it, excluding the plot code.  **Do NOT** copy any code of plotting figures and do not import **matplotlib**.  This is because the auto-grader cannot work with plotting.  **Do NOT** change the function names.  \n",

Then zip up the **two files inside the `Lab_5` folder**.  **Do NOT zip up the folder `Lab_5`** because the auto-grader cannot search inside a folder. Submit this zip file to Gradescope under `Lab_5_Code`. \n",

You will see the results of running autograder once you submit your code. Please follow the error messages to debug. Since those simple test cases are designed for debugging, it does not guaranttee your solution will work well on the real dataset. It is your responsibility to make your code logically correct.
